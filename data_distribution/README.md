The objective of this assignment is to learn a probability density function (PDF) from real-world air quality data.
We consider NO2 concentration values as the feature x and transform them into a new variable z using roll-number-dependent nonlinear transformation.
Then, we estimate the parameters of a given probability density function.
The goal is to learn parameters mu,sigma and c.
The probability function resemebles gaussian distribution.
We use Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
Output-
mu =25.81266175882587
lambda = 0.001460577420359888
c = 0.021561916251515552
A histogram of transformed data z is plotted along with the learned probability density function.
